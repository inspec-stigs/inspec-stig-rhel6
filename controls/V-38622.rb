This ensures "postfix" accepts mail messages (such as cron job reports) from the local system only, and not from the network, which protects it from network attack.

Edit the file "/etc/postfix/main.cf" to ensure that only the following "inet_interfaces" line appears:

inet_interfaces = localhost
'
  tag checktext: '
If the system is an authorized mail relay host, this is not applicable.

Run the following command to ensure postfix accepts mail messages from only the local system:

$ grep inet_interfaces /etc/postfix/main.cf

If properly configured, the output should show only "localhost".
If it does not, this is a finding.
