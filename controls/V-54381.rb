Administrators should be made aware of an inability to record audit records. If a separate partition or logical volume of adequate size is used, running low on space for audit records should never occur.

The "auditd" service can be configured to take an action when disk space is running low but prior to running out of space completely. Edit the file "/etc/audit/auditd.conf". Add or modify the following line, substituting [ACTION] appropriately:

admin_space_left_action = [ACTION]

Set this value to "single" to cause the system to switch to single-user mode for corrective action. Acceptable values also include "suspend" and "halt". For certain systems, the need for availability outweighs the need to log all actions, and a different setting should be determined. Details regarding all possible values for [ACTION] are described in the "auditd.conf" man page.

  tag checktext: '
Inspect "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" and locate the following line to determine if the system is configured to either suspend, switch to single-user mode, or halt when disk space has run low:

admin_space_left_action single

If the system is not configured to switch to single-user mode for corrective action, this is a finding.
