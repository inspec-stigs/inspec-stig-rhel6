To disable the ability for users to perform interactive startups, edit the file "/etc/sysconfig/init". Add or correct the line:

PROMPT=no

The "PROMPT" option allows the console user to perform an interactive system startup, in which it is possible to select the set of services which are started on boot.
'
  tag checktext: '
To check whether interactive boot is disabled, run the following command:

$ grep PROMPT /etc/sysconfig/init

If interactive boot is disabled, the output will show:

PROMPT=no


If it does not, this is a finding.
