The umask value influences the permissions assigned to files when they are created. A misconfigured umask value could result in files with excessive permissions that can be read and/or written to by unauthorized users.

To ensure the default umask for users of the C shell is set properly, add or correct the "umask" setting in "/etc/csh.cshrc" to read as follows:

umask 077
'
  tag checktext: '
Verify the "umask" setting is configured correctly in the "/etc/csh.cshrc" file by running the following command:

# grep "umask" /etc/csh.cshrc

All output must show the value of "umask" set to 077, as shown in the below:

# grep "umask" /etc/csh.cshrc
umask 077


If the above command returns no output, or if the umask is configured incorrectly, this is a finding.
