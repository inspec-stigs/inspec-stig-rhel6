To ensure the SSH idle timeout occurs precisely when the "ClientAliveCountMax" is set, edit "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" as follows:

ClientAliveCountMax 0
'
  tag checktext: '
To ensure the SSH idle timeout will occur when the "ClientAliveCountMax" is set, run the following command:

# grep ClientAliveCountMax /etc/ssh/sshd_config

If properly configured, output should be:

ClientAliveCountMax 0


If it is not, this is a finding.
