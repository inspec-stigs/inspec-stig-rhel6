Removing the "telnet-server" package decreases the risk of the unencrypted telnet service\'s accidental (or intentional) activation.

Mitigation:  If the telnet-server package is configured to only allow encrypted sessions, such as with Kerberos or the use of encrypted network tunnels, the risk of exposing sensitive information is mitigated.
