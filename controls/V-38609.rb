The "tftp" service should be disabled. The "tftp" service can be disabled with the following command:

# chkconfig tftp off
'
  tag checktext: '
To check that the "tftp" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command:

# chkconfig "tftp" --list

Output should indicate the "tftp" service has either not been installed, or has been disabled, as shown in the example below:

# chkconfig "tftp" --list
tftp off
OR
error reading information on service tftp: No such file or directory


If the service is running, this is a finding.
