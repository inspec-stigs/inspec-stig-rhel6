The root user should never be allowed to log in to a system directly over a network. To disable root login via SSH, add or correct the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config":

PermitRootLogin no
'
  tag checktext: '
To determine how the SSH daemon\'s "PermitRootLogin" option is set, run the following command:

# grep -i PermitRootLogin /etc/ssh/sshd_config

If a line indicating "no" is returned, then the required value is set.
If the required value is not set, this is a finding.
