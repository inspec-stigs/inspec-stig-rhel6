The ".netrc" files contain logon information used to auto-logon into FTP servers and reside in the user\'s home directory. These files may contain unencrypted passwords to remote FTP servers making them susceptible to access by unauthorized users and should not be used. Any ".netrc" files should be removed.
'
  tag checktext: '
To check the system for the existence of any ".netrc" files, run the following command:

$ sudo find /root /home -xdev -name .netrc

If any .netrc files exist, this is a finding.
