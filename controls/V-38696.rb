By default, AIDE does not install itself for periodic execution. Periodically running AIDE may reveal unexpected changes in installed files.

AIDE should be executed on a periodic basis to check for changes. To implement a daily execution of AIDE at 4:05am using cron, add the following line to /etc/crontab:

05 4 * * * root /usr/sbin/aide --check

AIDE can be executed periodically through other means; this is merely one example.

To determine that periodic AIDE execution has been scheduled, run the following command:

# grep aide /etc/crontab /etc/cron.*/*

If there is no output, this is a finding.
