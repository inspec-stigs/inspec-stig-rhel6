To restrict root logins on serial ports, ensure lines of this form do not appear in "/etc/securetty":

ttyS0
ttyS1

Note:  Serial port entries are not limited to those listed above.  Any lines starting with "ttyS" followed by numerals should be removed

  tag checktext: '
To check for serial port entries which permit root login, run the following command:

# grep \'^ttyS[0-9]\' /etc/securetty

If any output is returned, then root login over serial ports is permitted.
If root login over serial ports is permitted, this is a finding.
