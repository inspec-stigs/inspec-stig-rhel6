The network environment should not be modified by anything other than administrator action. Any change to network parameters should be audited.

Add the following to "/etc/audit/audit.rules", setting ARCH to either b32 or b64 as appropriate for your system:

# audit_network_modifications
-a always,exit -F arch=ARCH -S sethostname -S setdomainname -k audit_network_modifications
-w /etc/issue -p wa -k audit_network_modifications
-w /etc/issue.net -p wa -k audit_network_modifications
-w /etc/hosts -p wa -k audit_network_modifications
-w /etc/sysconfig/network -p wa -k audit_network_modifications
'
  tag checktext: '
To determine if the system is configured to audit changes to its network configuration, run the following command:

auditctl -l | egrep \'(sethostname|setdomainname|/etc/issue|/etc/issue.net|/etc/hosts|/etc/sysconfig/network)\'

If the system is configured to watch for network configuration changes, a line should be returned for each file specified (and "perm=wa" should be indicated for each).
If the system is not configured to audit changes of the network configuration, this is a finding.
