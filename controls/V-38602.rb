The "rlogin" service, which is available with the "rsh-server" package and runs as a service through xinetd, should be disabled. The "rlogin" service can be disabled with the following command:

# chkconfig rlogin off
'
  tag checktext: '

To check that the "rlogin" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command:

# chkconfig "rlogin" --list

Output should indicate the "rlogin" service has either not been installed, or has been disabled, as shown in the example below:

# chkconfig "rlogin" --list
rlogin off
OR
error reading information on service rlogin: No such file or directory


If the service is running, this is a finding.
