  tag checktext: '
To verify this configuration, run the following command:

grep "banner_file" /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf

The output should show the value of "banner_file" is set to "/etc/issue", an example of which is shown below.

# grep "banner_file" /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
banner_file=/etc/issue


If it does not, this is a finding.
