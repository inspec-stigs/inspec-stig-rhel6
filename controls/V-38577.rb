In "/etc/libuser.conf", add or correct the following line in its "[defaults]" section to ensure the system will use the SHA-512 algorithm for password hashing:

crypt_style = sha512

Inspect "/etc/libuser.conf" and ensure the following line appears in the "[default]" section:

crypt_style = sha512


If it does not, this is a finding.
