Setting the SELinux policy to "targeted" or a more specialized policy ensures the system will confine processes that are likely to be targeted for exploitation, such as network or system services.

The SELinux "targeted" policy is appropriate for general-purpose desktops and servers, as well as systems in many other roles. To configure the system to use this policy, add or correct the following line in "/etc/selinux/config":

SELINUXTYPE=targeted

Other policies, such as "mls", provide additional security labeling and greater confinement but are not compatible with many general-purpose use cases.

  tag checktext: '
Check the file "/etc/selinux/config" and ensure the following line appears:

SELINUXTYPE=targeted

If it does not, this is a finding.
