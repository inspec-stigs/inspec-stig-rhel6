SSH allows administrators to set an idle timeout interval. After this interval has passed, the idle user will be automatically logged out.

To set an idle timeout interval, edit the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" as follows:

ClientAliveInterval [interval]

The timeout [interval] is given in seconds. To have a timeout of 15 minutes, set [interval] to 900.

If a shorter timeout has already been set for the login shell, that value will preempt any SSH setting made here. Keep in mind that some processes may stop SSH from correctly detecting that the user is idle.

Run the following command to see what the timeout interval is:

# grep ClientAliveInterval /etc/ssh/sshd_config

If properly configured, the output should be:

ClientAliveInterval 900


If it is not, this is a finding.
