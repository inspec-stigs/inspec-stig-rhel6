In "iptables" the default policy is applied only after all the applicable rules in the table are examined for a match. Setting the default policy to "DROP" implements proper design for a firewall, i.e., any packets which are not explicitly permitted should not be accepted.

To set the default policy to DROP (instead of ACCEPT) for the built-in INPUT chain which processes incoming packets, add or correct the following line in "/etc/sysconfig/iptables":

:INPUT DROP [0:0]
'
  tag checktext: '
Inspect the file "/etc/sysconfig/iptables" to determine the default policy for the INPUT chain. It should be set to DROP.

# grep ":INPUT" /etc/sysconfig/iptables

If the default policy for the INPUT chain is not set to DROP, this is a finding.
