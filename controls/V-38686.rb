In "iptables" the default policy is applied only after all the applicable rules in the table are examined for a match. Setting the default policy to "DROP" implements proper design for a firewall, i.e., any packets which are not explicitly permitted should not be accepted.

To set the default policy to DROP (instead of ACCEPT) for the built-in FORWARD chain which processes packets that will be forwarded from one interface to another, add or correct the following line in "/etc/sysconfig/iptables":

:FORWARD DROP [0:0]
'
  tag checktext: '
Run the following command to ensure the default "FORWARD" policy is "DROP":

grep ":FORWARD" /etc/sysconfig/iptables

The output must be the following:

# grep ":FORWARD" /etc/sysconfig/iptables
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]

If it is not, this is a finding.
