To enable the warning banner and ensure it is consistent across the system, add or correct the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config":

To determine how the SSH daemon\'s "Banner" option is set, run the following command:

# grep -i Banner /etc/ssh/sshd_config

If a line indicating /etc/issue is returned, then the required value is set.
If the required value is not set, this is a finding.
