The system\'s mandatory access policy (SELinux) should not be arbitrarily changed by anything other than administrator action. All changes to MAC policy should be audited.

Add the following to "/etc/audit/audit.rules":

-w /etc/selinux/ -p wa -k MAC-policy

To determine if the system is configured to audit changes to its SELinux configuration files, run the following command:

# auditctl -l | grep "dir=/etc/selinux"

If the system is configured to watch for changes to its SELinux configuration, a line should be returned (including "perm=wa" indicating permissions that are watched).
If the system is not configured to audit attempts to change the MAC policy, this is a finding.
