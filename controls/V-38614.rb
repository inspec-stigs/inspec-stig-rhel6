Configuring this setting for the SSH daemon provides additional assurance that remote login via SSH will require a password, even in the event of misconfiguration elsewhere.

To explicitly disallow remote login from accounts with empty passwords, add or correct the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config":

PermitEmptyPasswords no

Any accounts with empty passwords should be disabled immediately, and PAM configuration should prevent users from being able to assign themselves empty passwords.
'
  tag checktext: '
To determine how the SSH daemon\'s "PermitEmptyPasswords" option is set, run the following command:

# grep -i PermitEmptyPasswords /etc/ssh/sshd_config

If no line, a commented line, or a line indicating the value "no" is returned, then the required value is set.
If the required value is not set, this is a finding.
