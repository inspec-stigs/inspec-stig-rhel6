To require samba clients running "smbclient" to use packet signing, add the following to the "[global]" section of the Samba configuration file in "/etc/samba/smb.conf":

client signing = mandatory

Requiring samba clients such as "smbclient" to use packet signing ensures they can only communicate with servers that support packet signing.

  tag checktext: '
To verify that Samba clients running smbclient must use packet signing, run the following command:

# grep signing /etc/samba/smb.conf

The output should show:

client signing = mandatory


If it is not, this is a finding.
