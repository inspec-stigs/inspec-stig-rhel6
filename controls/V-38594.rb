The "rsh" service, which is available with the "rsh-server" package and runs as a service through xinetd, should be disabled. The "rsh" service can be disabled with the following command:

# chkconfig rsh off
'
  tag checktext: '
To check that the "rsh" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command:

# chkconfig "rsh" --list

Output should indicate the "rsh" service has either not been installed, or has been disabled, as shown in the example below:

# chkconfig "rsh" --list
rsh off
OR
error reading information on service rsh: No such file or directory


If the service is running, this is a finding.
