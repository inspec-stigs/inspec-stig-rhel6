The pam_cracklib module\'s "maxrepeat" parameter controls requirements for consecutive repeating characters. When set to a positive number, it will reject passwords which contain more than that number of consecutive characters. Add "maxrepeat=3" after pam_cracklib.so to prevent a run of (3 + 1) or more identical characters.

password required pam_cracklib.so maxrepeat=3
'
  tag checktext: '
To check the maximum value for consecutive repeating characters, run the following command:

$ grep pam_cracklib /etc/pam.d/system-auth

Look for the value of the "maxrepeat" parameter. The DoD requirement is 3.
If maxrepeat is not found or not set to the required value, this is a finding.
