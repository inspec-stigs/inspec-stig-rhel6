Locking out user accounts after a number of incorrect attempts prevents direct password guessing attacks. Ensuring that an administrator is involved in unlocking locked accounts draws appropriate attention to such situations.

To configure the system to lock out accounts after a number of incorrect logon attempts and require an administrator to unlock the account using "pam_faillock.so", modify the content of both "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" and "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" as follows:

Add the following line immediately before the "pam_unix.so" statement in the "AUTH" section:

auth required pam_faillock.so preauth silent deny=3 unlock_time=604800 fail_interval=900

Add the following line immediately after the "pam_unix.so" statement in the "AUTH" section:

auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail deny=3 unlock_time=604800 fail_interval=900

Add the following line immediately before the "pam_unix.so" statement in the "ACCOUNT" section:

account required pam_faillock.so

Note that any updates made to "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" and "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" may be overwritten by the "authconfig" program.  The "authconfig" program should not be used.

To ensure the failed password attempt policy is configured correctly, run the following command:

# grep pam_faillock /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/password-auth

The output should show "unlock_time=<some-large-number>"; the largest acceptable value is 604800 seconds (one week).
If that is not the case, this is a finding.
