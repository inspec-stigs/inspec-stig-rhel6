To restrict root logins through the (deprecated) virtual console devices, ensure lines of this form do not appear in "/etc/securetty":

vc/1
vc/2
vc/3
vc/4

Note:  Virtual console entries are not limited to those listed above.  Any lines starting with "vc/" followed by numerals should be removed.
'
  tag checktext: '
To check for virtual console entries which permit root login, run the following command:

# grep \'^vc/[0-9]\' /etc/securetty

If any output is returned, then root logins over virtual console devices is permitted.
If root login over virtual console devices is permitted, this is a finding.
