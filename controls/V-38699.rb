  desc '
Allowing a user account to own a world-writable directory is undesirable because it allows the owner of that directory to remove or replace any files that may be placed in the directory by other users.

All directories in local partitions which are world-writable should be owned by root or another system account. If any world-writable directories are not owned by a system account, this should be investigated. Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an appropriate group.

The following command will discover and print world-writable directories that are not owned by a system account, given the assumption that only system accounts have a uid lower than 500. Run it once for each local partition [PART]:

# find [PART] -xdev -type d -perm -0002 -uid +499 -print


If there is output, this is a finding.
