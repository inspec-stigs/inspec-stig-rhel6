The umask value influences the permissions assigned to files when they are created. A misconfigured umask value could result in files with excessive permissions that can be read and/or written to by unauthorized users.

To ensure the default umask controlled by "/etc/login.defs" is set properly, add or correct the "umask" setting in "/etc/login.defs" to read as follows:

UMASK 077
'
  tag checktext: '
Verify the "umask" setting is configured correctly in the "/etc/login.defs" file by running the following command:

# grep -i "umask" /etc/login.defs

All output must show the value of "umask" set to 077, as shown in the below:

# grep -i "umask" /etc/login.defs
UMASK 077


If the above command returns no output, or if the umask is configured incorrectly, this is a finding.
