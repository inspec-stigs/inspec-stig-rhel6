The Automatic Bug Reporting Tool ("abrtd") daemon collects and reports crash data when an application crash is detected. Using a variety of plugins, abrtd can email crash reports to system administrators, log crash reports to files, or forward crash reports to a centralized issue tracking system such as RHTSupport. The "abrtd" service can be disabled with the following commands:

# chkconfig abrtd off
# service abrtd stop
'
  tag checktext: '
To check that the "abrtd" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command:

# chkconfig "abrtd" --list

Output should indicate the "abrtd" service has either not been installed, or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

# chkconfig "abrtd" --list
"abrtd" 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off

Run the following command to verify "abrtd" is disabled through current runtime configuration:

# service abrtd status

If the service is disabled the command will return the following output:

abrtd is stopped


If the service is running, this is a finding.
