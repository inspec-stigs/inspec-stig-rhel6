Requiring digits makes password guessing attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.

The pam_cracklib module\'s "dcredit" parameter controls requirements for usage of digits in a password. When set to a negative number, any password will be required to contain that many digits. When set to a positive number, pam_cracklib will grant +1 additional length credit for each digit. Add "dcredit=-1" after pam_cracklib.so to require use of a digit in passwords.

  tag checktext: '
To check how many digits are required in a password, run the following command:

$ grep pam_cracklib /etc/pam.d/system-auth

The "dcredit" parameter (as a negative number) will indicate how many digits are required. The DoD requires at least one digit in a password. This would appear as "dcredit=-1".
If dcredit is not found or not set to the required value, this is a finding.
