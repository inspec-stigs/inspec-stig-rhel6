SELinux can be disabled at boot time by an argument in "/etc/grub.conf". Remove any instances of "selinux=0" from the kernel arguments in that file to prevent SELinux from being disabled at boot.

  tag checktext: '
Inspect "/etc/grub.conf" for any instances of "selinux=0" in the kernel boot arguments. Presence of "selinux=0" indicates that SELinux is disabled at boot time. If SELinux is disabled at boot time, this is a finding.
