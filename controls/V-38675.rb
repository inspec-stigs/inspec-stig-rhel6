To disable core dumps for all users, add the following line to "/etc/security/limits.conf":

* hard core 0
'
  tag checktext: '
To verify that core dumps are disabled for all users, run the following command:

$ grep core /etc/security/limits.conf /etc/security/limits.d/*.conf

The output should be:

* hard core 0

If it is not, this is a finding.
