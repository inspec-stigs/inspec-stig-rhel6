The "auditd" service can be configured to take an action when disk space starts to run low. Edit the file "/etc/audit/auditd.conf". Modify the following line, substituting [num_megabytes] appropriately:

space_left = [num_megabytes]

The "num_megabytes" value should be set to a fraction of the total audit storage capacity available that will allow a system administrator to be notified with enough time to respond to the situation causing the capacity issues.  This value must also be documented locally.

Inspect "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" and locate the following line to determine whether the system is configured to email the administrator when disk space is starting to run low:

# grep space_left /etc/audit/auditd.conf

space_left = [num_megabytes]


If the "num_megabytes" value does not correspond to a documented value for remaining audit partition capacity or if there is no locally documented value for remaining audit partition capacity, this is a finding.
