File permissions for "/boot/grub/grub.conf" should be set to 600, which is the default. To properly set the permissions of "/boot/grub/grub.conf", run the command:

# chmod 600 /boot/grub/grub.conf

Boot partitions based on VFAT, NTFS, or other non-standard configurations may require alternative measures.

To check the permissions of /etc/grub.conf, run the command:

$ sudo ls -lL /etc/grub.conf
