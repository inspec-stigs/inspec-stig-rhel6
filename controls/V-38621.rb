To specify a remote NTP server for time synchronization, edit the file "/etc/ntp.conf". Add or correct the following lines, substituting the IP or hostname of a remote NTP server for ntpserver.

server [ntpserver]

This instructs the NTP software to contact that remote server to obtain time data.
'
  tag checktext: '
A remote NTP server should be configured for time synchronization. To verify one is configured, open the following file.

/etc/ntp.conf

In the file, there should be a section similar to the following:

# --- OUR TIMESERVERS -----
server [ntpserver]


If this is not the case, this is a finding.
