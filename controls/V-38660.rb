Edit "/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf", removing any references to "v1", "v2c", or "com2sec". Upon doing that, restart the SNMP service:

# service snmpd restart
'
  tag checktext: '
To ensure only SNMPv3 or newer is used, run the following command:

# grep \'v1\|v2c\|com2sec\' /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf | grep -v \'^#\'

There should be no output.
If there is output, this is a finding.
