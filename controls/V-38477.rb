To specify password minimum age for new accounts, edit the file "/etc/login.defs" and add or correct the following line, replacing [DAYS] appropriately:

PASS_MIN_DAYS [DAYS]

A value of 1 day is considered sufficient for many environments. The DoD requirement is 1.

  tag checktext: '
To check the minimum password age, run the command:

$ grep PASS_MIN_DAYS /etc/login.defs

The DoD requirement is 1.
If it is not set to the required value, this is a finding.
