The ssl directive specifies whether to use ssl or not. If not specified it will default to "no". It should be set to "start_tls" rather than doing LDAP over SSL.

Configure LDAP to enforce TLS use. First, edit the file "/etc/pam_ldap.conf", and add or correct the following lines:

ssl start_tls

Then review the LDAP server and ensure TLS has been configured.

If the system does not use LDAP for authentication or account information, this is not applicable.

To ensure LDAP is configured to use TLS for all transactions, run the following command:

$ grep start_tls /etc/pam_ldap.conf


If no lines are returned, this is a finding.
