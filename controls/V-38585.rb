Password protection on the boot loader configuration ensures users with physical access cannot trivially alter important bootloader settings. These include which kernel to use, and whether to enter single-user mode.

The grub boot loader should have password protection enabled to protect boot-time settings. To do so, select a password and then generate a hash from it by running the following command:

# grub-crypt --sha-512

When prompted to enter a password, insert the following line into "/etc/grub.conf" immediately after the header comments. (Use the output from "grub-crypt" as the value of [password-hash]):

password --encrypted [password-hash]
'
  tag checktext: '
To verify the boot loader password has been set and encrypted, run the following command:

# grep password /etc/grub.conf

The output should show the following:

password --encrypted $6$[rest-of-the-password-hash]

If it does not, this is a finding.
