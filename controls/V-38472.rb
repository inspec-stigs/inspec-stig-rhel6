System executables are stored in the following directories by default:

/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
/sbin
/usr/sbin
/usr/local/sbin

If any file [FILE] in these directories is found to be owned by a user other than root, correct its ownership with the following command:

# chown root [FILE]

System executables are stored in the following directories by default:

/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
/sbin
/usr/sbin
/usr/local/sbin

All files in these directories should not be group-writable or world-writable. To find system executables that are not owned by "root", run the following command for each directory [DIR] which contains system executables:

$ find -L [DIR] \! -user root


If any system executables are found to not be owned by root, this is a finding.
