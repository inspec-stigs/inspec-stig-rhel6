Requiring a minimum number of special characters makes password guessing attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.

The pam_cracklib module\'s "ocredit=" parameter controls requirements for usage of special (or ``other\'\') characters in a password. When set to a negative number, any password will be required to contain that many special characters. When set to a positive number, pam_cracklib will grant +1 additional length credit for each special character. Add "ocredit=-1" after pam_cracklib.so to require use of a special character in passwords.

  tag checktext: '
To check how many special characters are required in a password, run the following command:

$ grep pam_cracklib /etc/pam.d/system-auth

The "ocredit" parameter (as a negative number) will indicate how many special characters are required. The DoD requires at least one special character in a password. This would appear as "ocredit=-1".
If ocredit is not found or not set to the required value, this is a finding.
