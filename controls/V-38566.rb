Unsuccessful attempts to access files could be an indicator of malicious activity on a system. Auditing these events could serve as evidence of potential system compromise.

At a minimum, the audit system should collect unauthorized file accesses for all users and root. Add the following to "/etc/audit/audit.rules", setting ARCH to either b32 or b64 as appropriate for your system:

-a always,exit -F arch=ARCH -S creat -S open -S openat -S truncate \
-S ftruncate -F exit=-EACCES -F auid>=500 -F auid!=4294967295 -k access
-a always,exit -F arch=ARCH -S creat -S open -S openat -S truncate \
-S ftruncate -F exit=-EPERM -F auid>=500 -F auid!=4294967295 -k access
-a always,exit -F arch=ARCH -S creat -S open -S openat -S truncate \
-S ftruncate -F exit=-EACCES -F auid=0 -k access
-a always,exit -F arch=ARCH -S creat -S open -S openat -S truncate \
-S ftruncate -F exit=-EPERM -F auid=0 -k access
'
  tag checktext: '
To verify that the audit system collects unauthorized file accesses, run the following commands:

# grep EACCES /etc/audit/audit.rules



# grep EPERM /etc/audit/audit.rules


If either command lacks output, this is a finding.
