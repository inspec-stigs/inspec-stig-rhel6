  desc '
The total storage for audit log files must be large enough to retain log information over the period required. This is a function of the maximum log file size and the number of logs retained.

Determine how many log files "auditd" should retain when it rotates logs. Edit the file "/etc/audit/auditd.conf". Add or modify the following line, substituting [NUMLOGS] with the correct value:

num_logs = [NUMLOGS]

Set the value to 5 for general-purpose systems. Note that values less than 2 result in no log rotation.
'
  tag checktext: '
Inspect "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" and locate the following line to determine how many logs the system is configured to retain after rotation: "# grep num_logs /etc/audit/auditd.conf"

num_logs = 5


If the overall system log file(s) retention hasn\'t been properly set up, this is a finding.
