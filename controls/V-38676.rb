Removing all packages which constitute the X Window System ensures users or malicious software cannot start X. To do so, run the following command:

# yum groupremove "X Window System"
'
  tag checktext: '
To ensure the X Windows package group is removed, run the following command:

$ rpm -qi xorg-x11-server-common

The output should be:

package xorg-x11-server-common is not installed


If it is not, this is a finding.
