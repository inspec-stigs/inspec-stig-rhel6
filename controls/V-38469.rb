System executables are stored in the following directories by default:

/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
/sbin
/usr/sbin
/usr/local/sbin

If any file in these directories is found to be group-writable or world-writable, correct its permission with the following command:

# chmod go-w [FILE]

System executables are stored in the following directories by default:

/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
/sbin
/usr/sbin
/usr/local/sbin

All files in these directories should not be group-writable or world-writable. To find system executables that are group-writable or world-writable, run the following command for each directory [DIR] which contains system executables:

$ find -L [DIR] -perm /022 -type f

If any system executables are found to be group-writable or world-writable, this is a finding.
