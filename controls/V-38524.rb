Accepting ICMP redirects has few legitimate uses. It should be disabled unless it is absolutely required.

To set the runtime status of the "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects" kernel parameter, run the following command:

# sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0

If this is not the system\'s default value, add the following line to "/etc/sysctl.conf":

net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0

  tag checktext: '
The status of the "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects" kernel parameter can be queried by running the following command:

$ sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects

The output of the command should indicate a value of "0". If this value is not the default value, investigate how it could have been adjusted at runtime, and verify it is not set improperly in "/etc/sysctl.conf".

$ grep net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects /etc/sysctl.conf

If the correct value is not returned, this is a finding.
