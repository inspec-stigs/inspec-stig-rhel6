If a device file carries the SELinux type "unlabeled_t", then SELinux cannot properly restrict access to the device file.

Device files, which are used for communication with important system resources, should be labeled with proper SELinux types. If any device files carry the SELinux type "unlabeled_t", investigate the cause and correct the file\'s context.

  tag checktext: '
To check for unlabeled device files, run the following command:

# ls -RZ /dev | grep unlabeled_t

It should produce no output in a well-configured system.

If there is output, this is a finding.
