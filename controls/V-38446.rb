Set up an alias for root that forwards to a monitored email address:

# echo "root: <system.administrator>@mail.mil" >> /etc/aliases
# newaliases
'
  tag checktext: '
Find the list of alias maps used by the Postfix mail server:

# postconf alias_maps

Query the Postfix alias maps for an alias for "root":

# postmap -q root <alias_map>

If there are no aliases configured for root that forward to a monitored email address, this is a finding.
