The Openswan package provides an implementation of IPsec and IKE, which permits the creation of secure tunnels over untrusted networks. The "openswan" package can be installed with the following command:

# yum install openswan

If the system does not communicate over untrusted networks, this is not applicable.

Run the following command to determine if the "openswan" package is installed:
