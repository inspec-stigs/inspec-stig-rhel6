The tls_cacertdir or tls_cacertfile directives are required when tls_checkpeer is configured (which is the default for openldap versions 2.1 and up). These directives define the path to the trust certificates signed by the site CA.

Ensure a copy of the site\'s CA certificate has been placed in the file "/etc/pki/tls/CA/cacert.pem". Configure LDAP to enforce TLS use and to trust certificates signed by the site\'s CA. First, edit the file "/etc/pam_ldap.conf", and add or correct either of the following lines:

tls_cacertdir /etc/pki/tls/CA

or

tls_cacertfile /etc/pki/tls/CA/cacert.pem

Then review the LDAP server and ensure TLS has been configured.
'
  tag checktext: '
If the system does not use LDAP for authentication or account information, this is not applicable.

To ensure TLS is configured with trust certificates, run the following command:

# grep cert /etc/pam_ldap.conf


If there is no output, or the lines are commented out, this is a finding.
