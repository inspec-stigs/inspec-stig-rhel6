The total storage for audit log files must be large enough to retain log information over the period required. This is a function of the maximum log file size and the number of logs retained.

Determine the amount of audit data (in megabytes) which should be retained in each log file. Edit the file "/etc/audit/auditd.conf". Add or modify the following line, substituting the correct value for [STOREMB]:

max_log_file = [STOREMB]

Set the value to "6" (MB) or higher for general-purpose systems. Larger values, of course, support retention of even more audit data.
'
  tag checktext: '
Inspect "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" and locate the following line to determine how much data the system will retain in each audit log file: "# grep max_log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf"

max_log_file = 6


If the system audit data threshold hasn\'t been properly set up, this is a finding.
