By default the NFS server requires secure file-lock requests, which require credentials from the client in order to lock a file. Most NFS clients send credentials with file lock requests, however, there are a few clients that do not send credentials when requesting a file-lock, allowing the client to only be able to lock world-readable files. To get around this, the "insecure_locks" option can be used so these clients can access the desired export. This poses a security risk by potentially allowing the client access to data for which it does not have authorization. Remove any instances of the "insecure_locks" option from the file "/etc/exports".

To verify insecure file locking has been disabled, run the following command:

# grep insecure_locks /etc/exports


If there is output, this is a finding.
