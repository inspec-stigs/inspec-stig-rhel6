  desc '
Requiring a minimum number of different characters during password changes ensures that newly changed passwords should not resemble previously compromised ones. Note that passwords which are changed on compromised systems will still be compromised, however.

The pam_cracklib module\'s "difok" parameter controls requirements for usage of different characters during a password change. Add "difok=[NUM]" after pam_cracklib.so to require differing characters when changing passwords, substituting [NUM] appropriately. The DoD requirement is 4.
'
  tag checktext: '
To check how many characters must differ during a password change, run the following command:

$ grep pam_cracklib /etc/pam.d/system-auth

The "difok" parameter will indicate how many characters must differ. The DoD requires four characters differ during a password change. This would appear as "difok=4".
If difok is not found or not set to the required value, this is a finding.
