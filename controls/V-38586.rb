This prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing security on the machine and gaining root access. Such accesses are further prevented by configuring the bootloader password.

Single-user mode is intended as a system recovery method, providing a single user root access to the system by providing a boot option at startup. By default, no authentication is performed if single-user mode is selected.

To require entry of the root password even if the system is started in single-user mode, add or correct the following line in the file "/etc/sysconfig/init":

SINGLE=/sbin/sulogin
'
  tag checktext: '
To check if authentication is required for single-user mode, run the following command:

$ grep SINGLE /etc/sysconfig/init

The output should be the following:

SINGLE=/sbin/sulogin


If the output is different, this is a finding.
