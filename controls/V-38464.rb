Edit the file "/etc/audit/auditd.conf". Modify the following line, substituting [ACTION] appropriately:

disk_error_action = [ACTION]

Possible values for [ACTION] are described in the "auditd.conf" man page. These include:

"ignore"
"syslog"
"exec"
"suspend"
"single"
"halt"


Set this to "syslog", "exec", "single", or "halt".

Inspect "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" and locate the following line to determine if the system is configured to take appropriate action when disk errors occur:

# grep disk_error_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf
disk_error_action = [ACTION]


If the system is configured to "suspend" when disk errors occur or "ignore" them, this is a finding.
