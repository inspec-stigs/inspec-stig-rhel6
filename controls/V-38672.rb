The "netconsole" service is not necessary unless there is a need to debug kernel panics, which is not common.

The "netconsole" service is responsible for loading the netconsole kernel module, which logs kernel printk messages over UDP to a syslog server. This allows debugging of problems where disk logging fails and serial consoles are impractical. The "netconsole" service can be disabled with the following commands:

# chkconfig netconsole off
# service netconsole stop
'
  tag checktext: '
To check that the "netconsole" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command:

# chkconfig "netconsole" --list

Output should indicate the "netconsole" service has either not been installed, or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

# chkconfig "netconsole" --list
"netconsole" 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off

Run the following command to verify "netconsole" is disabled through current runtime configuration:

# service netconsole status

If the service is disabled the command will return the following output:

netconsole is stopped


If the service is running, this is a finding.
