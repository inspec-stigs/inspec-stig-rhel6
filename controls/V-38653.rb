Edit "/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf", remove default community string "public". Upon doing that, restart the SNMP service:

# service snmpd restart
'
  tag checktext: '
To ensure the default password is not set, run the following command:

# grep -v "^#" /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf| grep public

There should be no output.
If there is output, this is a finding.
