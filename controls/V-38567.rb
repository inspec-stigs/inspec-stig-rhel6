Privileged programs are subject to escalation-of-privilege attacks, which attempt to subvert their normal role of providing some necessary but limited capability. As such, motivation exists to monitor these programs for unusual activity.

At a minimum, the audit system should collect the execution of privileged commands for all users and root. To find the relevant setuid / setgid programs, run the following command for each local partition [PART]:

$ sudo find [PART] -xdev -type f -perm /6000 2>/dev/null

Then, for each setuid / setgid program on the system, add a line of the following form to "/etc/audit/audit.rules", where [SETUID_PROG_PATH] is the full path to each setuid / setgid program in the list:

-a always,exit -F path=[SETUID_PROG_PATH] -F perm=x -F auid>=500 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged
'
  tag checktext: '
To verify that auditing of privileged command use is configured, run the following command once for each local partition [PART] to find relevant setuid / setgid programs:

$ sudo find [PART] -xdev -type f -perm /6000 2>/dev/null

Run the following command to verify entries in the audit rules for all programs found with the previous command:

$ sudo grep path /etc/audit/audit.rules

It should be the case that all relevant setuid / setgid programs have a line in the audit rules. If that is not the case, this is a finding.
